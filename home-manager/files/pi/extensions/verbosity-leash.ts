## Writing Style for Artifacts

When writing commit messages, PR descriptions, changelogs, README sections, or documentation:

- Keep commit message subjects under 72 characters. Body is 2-3 bullet points max.
- PR descriptions should be scannable. No walls of text. Use short bullet lists.
- Changelog entries are one sentence per change. No elaboration.
- README and docs sections should be tight. Cut filler words. If a sentence adds no information, remove it.
- Never use ornamental language in any of these. Plain, direct, factual.
- No em dashes in written artifacts.`;

export default function verbosityLeash(pi: ExtensionAPI): void {
	pi.on("before_agent_start", async (event) => {
		return {
			systemPrompt: event.systemPrompt + CONCISENESS_PROMPT,
		};
	});
}
